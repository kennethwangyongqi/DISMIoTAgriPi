## Section 1 Overview of AgriPi

### What is AgriPi about?
AgriPi is a smart agriculture/automated watering plant system, targetted at home owners who may be overseas on a trip but are unable to attend to their crop. The app has several functions to help monitor and perform actions to control the application from a remote location, such as turning on/off the lighting in the event of low light value, updating the status of the crop by having the Raspberry PI camera to take a picture at that state on demand. 

The next target audience are crop farmers. It will be an added beneficial for the farmers as they are tending to a crop, but not to the massive other plot of crops in the big landscape. Thus, this IoT web app could allow them to monitor the overall temperature and humidity of the environment and if there is a need to, a buzzer can be switched on or off to inform the farmer that a specific crop may require itâ€™s attention. The temperature and humidity will also be displayed on a LCD screen and updated constantly to provide the latest values on ground, an added value to provide them while they are not accessing the web app via the internet.
